## About The Project

This repository provides a set of simple and user-friendly Python classes built on PyTorch to streamline the development of RNN models for learning and predicting the dynamics of various dynamic systems. These classes simplify the process of training, and evaluating RNNs specifically tailored for tasks involving dynamic systems identification and prediction.

The core of this project lies in three key classes:

1. `DataGenerator`: This class acts as your data wrangler. It takes a function defining your specific dynamic system and generates training and validation datasets. Internally, it propagates the system's states over multiple time steps, providing the necessary input-output pairs for training your RNN model.

</p>

1. `Trainer`: This class takes charge of the training process. It requires your PyTorch model architecture, the datasets generated by `DataGenerator`, and other parameters like the number of training epochs, the optimizer model and loss function model. The `Trainer` class handles the backpropagation and model updates, guiding your RNN towards optimal performance in capturing the system's dynamics.

2. `Tester`: This class evaluates the trained model's performance. It allows you to test the model's prediction accuracy on unseen data from the dynamic system.

## Installation

1. Clone SINNets repository

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:SlowWave/SINNets.git
```

1. Install the libraries listed in *requirements.txt*

```sh
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The /src/examples folder within the repository provides three illustrative examples showcasing the usage of the classes for different dynamic systems:

- Mass Spring Damper: simple linear dynamic system;
- Simple Pendulum: simple non-linear dynamic system;
- Lorenz Attractor: complex non-linear dynamic system with chaotic behaviour.

The provided examples serves as a stepping stone. You can adapt the code to your specific system, model architecture, optimizer and loss function to achieve optimal results. Moreover you can:

-  Model your own dynamic system starting from the DynamicSystem class;
-  Define advance Neural Networks using the Pytorch nn.Module class.
